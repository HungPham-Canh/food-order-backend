In fact, it is one of the few dishes my dad enjoys cooking because it has a short list of simple ingredients that transform into something delicious. This is one of those special recipes that rewards low effort with high reward. ",
              "description": "Chinese tomato egg is commonly served with a bowl of jasmine rice. The saucy tomatoes will infuse and permeate through the grains, making each bite of rice exciting. The tomatoes add a slight tang that is balanced with a little sugar, and the gently scrambled eggs add a soft, silky, and velvety texture and soak up all the delicious flavors.",
